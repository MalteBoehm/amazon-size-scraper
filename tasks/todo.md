# Product Lifecycle Consumer - Implementation Tasks

## Problem
- 119 products in database with status='pending' 
- 121 NEW_PRODUCT_DETECTED events in Redis stream
- No service is consuming these events to extract size data

## Solution
Create a minimal event consumer that processes pending products by extracting their size data.

## Todo List

### Phase 1: Minimal Consumer (1 hour)
- [ ] Create simple Go program that connects to Redis
- [ ] Read events from `product:events:stream` using consumer group
- [ ] Parse NEW_PRODUCT_DETECTED event payload
- [ ] Log events to verify it's working

### Phase 2: Size Extraction (30 min)
- [ ] Create HTTP client for Amazon Scraper API
- [ ] Call POST `/api/v1/scraper/size-chart` with ASIN
- [ ] Handle response (dimensions or not found)
- [ ] Add simple retry logic (3 attempts)

### Phase 3: Database Updates (30 min)
- [ ] Update product with dimensions if found
- [ ] Set status='rejected' if no length
- [ ] Set status='active' if has length
- [ ] Update scraped_at timestamp

### Phase 4: Event Publishing (30 min)
- [ ] Define PRODUCT_CREATED event structure
- [ ] Publish to Redis only if product has length
- [ ] Include dimensions in event payload
- [ ] Add quality_score field (simple: 3.0 if length exists)

### Phase 5: Run & Test (30 min)
- [ ] Create simple Makefile target
- [ ] Test with existing pending products
- [ ] Verify database updates
- [ ] Check PRODUCT_CREATED events in Redis

## Review

### Summary of Changes

Created a minimal Product Lifecycle Consumer that processes NEW_PRODUCT_DETECTED events from Redis and extracts product dimensions using the Amazon Scraper API.

### Implementation Details

1. **Single File Solution** (`cmd/lifecycle-consumer/main.go`)
   - Connects to Redis (stream: `stream:product_lifecycle`) 
   - Connects to PostgreSQL database
   - Uses consumer group pattern for reliable message processing
   - HTTP client calls Amazon Scraper API

2. **Key Features**
   - Automatically creates products if they don't exist in DB
   - Extracts dimensions via `/api/v1/scraper/size-chart` endpoint
   - Updates product status based on dimensions:
     - `active` if length > 0
     - `rejected` if no length found
   - Publishes PRODUCT_CREATED events for products with length
   - Includes simple retry logic (3 attempts) for API calls

3. **Database Updates**
   - Sets `width_cm`, `length_cm`, `height_cm` from API response
   - Updates `status` field appropriately
   - Sets `scraped_at` timestamp

4. **Event Publishing**
   - PRODUCT_CREATED events include:
     - Product details (ASIN, title, brand, URL)
     - Dimensions object
     - Quality score (3.0 if has length)

### Testing Results

Successfully processed events from Redis:
- 2 products processed and marked as 'rejected' (no size charts)
- Consumer group working correctly
- API integration functioning properly
- Database updates confirmed

### Next Steps

1. Process the 119 pending products from `product:events:stream`
2. Monitor for products with actual length measurements
3. Verify PRODUCT_CREATED events are published correctly
4. Consider adding more sophisticated quality scoring logic later
