# Amazon Size Scraper - Ideas & Future Considerations

## Alternative Approaches

### Hybrid Data Collection
- Combine official Amazon API with selective scraping
- Use API for basic data, scrape only for dimensions
- Fallback mechanism when API limits are reached

### Crowd-Sourced Data
- Build browser extension for voluntary data contribution
- Users browse normally, extension captures size data
- Completely legal and undetectable approach

### Partnership Opportunities
- Contact Amazon for special API access
- Collaborate with price comparison sites
- License data from existing aggregators

## Performance Optimizations

### Smart Caching
- Cache product dimensions by ASIN
- Implement TTL based on product category
- Share cache across scraper instances
- Predictive pre-fetching for popular items

### Request Optimization
- Batch similar products in same session
- Use GraphQL if Amazon exposes it
- Download only necessary page sections
- Compress and stream data transfers

### Browser Pool Management
- Pre-warm browser instances
- Intelligent instance recycling
- Memory-efficient headless configurations
- GPU acceleration for rendering

## Advanced Features

### Machine Learning Integration
- Train model to extract sizes from product images
- NLP for parsing size from descriptions
- Anomaly detection for data validation
- Predict HTML structure changes

### Multi-Marketplace Support
- Extend to Amazon.com, .co.uk, .fr
- Handle regional size standards (EU/US/UK)
- Currency and unit conversions
- Language-agnostic parsing

### Real-Time Monitoring
- Live dashboard for scraping metrics
- Automatic alerting on failures
- Visual debugging of failed extractions
- A/B testing for scraping strategies

## Technical Innovations

### WebAssembly Scraper
- Compile Go scraper to WASM
- Run directly in browser environment
- Ultimate stealth - indistinguishable from real user
- Distributed across user browsers

### Blockchain Storage
- Immutable size data history
- Decentralized data verification
- Community-validated information
- Incentivized data contribution

### Edge Computing
- Deploy scrapers to CDN edge nodes
- Reduce latency and improve geographic distribution
- Lower detection risk with diverse IPs
- Scale automatically with demand
