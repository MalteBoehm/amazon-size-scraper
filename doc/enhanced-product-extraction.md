# Enhanced Product Extraction Implementation

## Overview

This document describes the implementation of comprehensive product extraction with size table validation for the Amazon scraper. The system now extracts complete product data and only processes products with valid size tables containing length and width measurements.

## Key Changes

### 1. Database Layer Migration

- **From**: `products` table (minimal fields)
- **To**: `product` table (comprehensive fields)
- Added migration: `004_add_size_table_remove_dimensions.up.sql`
- Implemented `ProductLifecycle` struct and methods
- Deprecated old `products` table methods

### 2. Enhanced Event Payload

The `NEW_PRODUCT_DETECTED` event now includes:
- Complete product information (title, brand, category, URL)
- Pricing data (current_price, currency)
- Reviews (rating, review_count)
- Media (image_urls array)
- Product details (features array)
- Size information (available_sizes array)
- **Size table with validated measurements** (JSONB)

### 3. Comprehensive Product Extraction

New `ProductExtractor` class that:
- Navigates to product pages
- Extracts all product data in one pass
- Validates size tables for length/width measurements
- Only returns products with valid size tables

### 4. Updated Worker Flow

```go
// Old flow:
1. Find product in search results
2. Save basic info to database
3. Publish minimal event
4. Lifecycle consumer enriches data

// New flow:
1. Find product in search results
2. Extract complete product data including size table
3. Validate size table has length and width
4. Save complete data to product table
5. Publish enriched event with all data
```

### 5. Size Table Validation

Products are only processed if their size table contains:
- At least one size with both length AND width measurements
- Valid measurement structure with unit (e.g., "cm")

Example valid size table:
```json
{
  "sizes": ["S", "M", "L", "XL"],
  "measurements": {
    "S": {"chest": 96, "length": 70, "width": 52},
    "M": {"chest": 100, "length": 72, "width": 54},
    "L": {"chest": 104, "length": 74, "width": 56},
    "XL": {"chest": 108, "length": 76, "width": 58}
  },
  "unit": "cm"
}
```

## Architecture Benefits

1. **Single Source of Truth**: Using the `product` table across all services
2. **Complete Data in Events**: No need for enrichment in lifecycle consumer
3. **Quality Control**: Only products with proper size measurements are processed
4. **Performance**: One extraction pass instead of multiple enrichment calls
5. **Consistency**: Unified data model across scraper and consumer

## Testing

Created comprehensive tests for:
- Database operations with `product` table
- Size table validation logic
- Enhanced event payload structure
- Product extraction functionality
- Integration flow

## Migration Notes

1. Old `products` table methods are deprecated but not removed
2. Existing code using old methods will continue to work
3. New code should use `ProductLifecycle` methods
4. Migration script handles schema changes automatically

## Usage

### Creating a Scraping Job

```go
// Job will automatically:
// 1. Search for products
// 2. Extract complete data for each product
// 3. Validate size tables
// 4. Only process products with length/width measurements
// 5. Publish enriched events

job, err := jobManager.CreateJob(ctx, "rotes t-shirt m√§nner", "fashion-mens", 5)
```

### Event Consumer

The lifecycle consumer receives complete product data:
```go
// Event payload now includes:
{
  "asin": "B08N5WRWNW",
  "title": "Herren T-Shirt Rot",
  "brand": "Example Brand",
  "category": "Clothing",
  "detail_page_url": "https://www.amazon.de/dp/B08N5WRWNW",
  "current_price": 29.99,
  "currency": "EUR",
  "rating": 4.5,
  "review_count": 150,
  "images": ["url1", "url2"],
  "features": ["100% Cotton", "Machine washable"],
  "available_sizes": ["S", "M", "L", "XL"],
  "size_table": { /* complete measurements */ },
  "source": "scraper"
}
```

## Configuration

No additional configuration required. The system automatically:
- Detects products without valid size tables
- Skips products missing length/width measurements
- Logs skipped products for monitoring

## Monitoring

Track these metrics:
- Products found vs products processed ratio
- Size table validation failures
- Event publishing success rate
- Product extraction duration

## Future Enhancements

1. Support for different measurement units (inches, etc.)
2. Configurable validation rules per category
3. Batch processing optimization
4. Size recommendation algorithm based on measurements
